Site Reliability Engineer - September 2019 to Present</h4>
<p>At LinkedIn I’m a technical leader on an Infrastructure SRE team. My
main focus over the last several years has been developing a
comprehensive framework for testing OS snapshot releases. My work has
included everything from writing the design documentation to
implementing the actual code in Python whuke at the same time mentoring
other members of the team. This system is currently operational and used
to test every OS release before it is rolled out to the many thousands
of servers that run LinkedIn. I’m also currently doing the design and
coding work to integrate our testing with Azure as LinkedIn moves to the
cloud.</p>
<p>My passion in the last year has been improving code quality across
our SRE organization. To do this I’ve written numerous internal blog
posts and other documentation on the subject and implemented several new
code quality tools in our deployment pipeline.</p>

<h4
id="senior-security-operations-engineer---november-2016-to-august-2019">Senior
Security Operations Engineer - November 2016 to August 2019</h4>
<p>I was brought on to the new Oracle Cloud to be a technical lead in
the Security Operations group. I was responsible for the technical
direction of the team and in general for defining Security Operations
for Oracle Cloud. This included work such as implementing our first
vulnerability scanning system and scaling out a yubikey-based
authentication solution for internal users.</p>
<p>Much of my development work revolved around our software patching
system. I took an initial system based on Fabric and scaled it up to
patch several hundred servers on a monthly basis (with a comprehensive
health check mechanism to avoid outages). This included both Python and
Bash scripting. I also did reverse engineering work on our yubikey
programming system to both document and improve it (that was in
Ruby).</p>
<p>I also managed metrics and alerting for the team, in our in-house
system. It used a Grafana front end and I was responsible for designing
and implementing dashboards.</p>
<p>I also ran a biweekly team operational excellence meeting, focused on
ensuring that we took proper steps to correct outages and improved our
general operational ability.</p>

<h4 id="senior-production-engineer---july-2015-to-november-2016">Senior
Production Engineer - July 2015 to November 2016</h4>
<p>At Lookout I was part of the Production Engineering team. My
responsibilities included designing deployment and automation services
on Amazon AWS.</p>
<p>I worked on a lot of deployment automation using NixOS, a declarative
Linux OS which allows you to precisely specify the deployment state of a
service. For example, I wrote a a completely automated deployment
process using NixOS to install Artifactory to Amazon EC2. I also wrote
code using Boto to automate other parts of our AWS infrastructure.</p>
<p>I also managed other developer services like Jenkins and Gerrit, and
assisted with various other duties involving our build pipeline. In
addition, I worked with AWS tooling such as EC2, S3, and CloudWatch.</p>

<p>I was part of the DevOps team and I wore many hats. I handled
everything from writing scripts to automate Mysql server failovers to
overseeing our monitoring setup.</p>
<p>A key project I worked on while I was at Goodreads was a complete
move of our infrastructure from a datacenter to AWS.</p>

Release Management - September 2011 to April 2014</h4>
<p>I managed a team of three people who are responsible for software
releases across all of Yahoo Communications (including Mail and
Messenger). My team set standards for software releases, planned the
releases, and pushed the software to production servers. We regularly
pushed changes to 10,000 servers a week. I covered everything from
planning our strategic projects to writing perl scripts to analyze
install logs. I also coordinated the activities of our Sunnyvale and
Bangalore Release Management teams.</p>
<p><em>Highlight</em>: Wrote a series of perl scripts to analyze mail
farm software release quality. Trained Release and QA teams to use these
scripts to automate release testing, resulting in a 75% reduction in QA
support requests to my group.</p>

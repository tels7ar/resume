## Overview

I'm a senior system administrator and team leader
[with a focus on DevOps][]. Recently I moved from being a tech lead to
managing a small group of highly skilled people. I love working with
Linux and writing scripts to [manage large-scale deployment issues][].

## Experience

### [Yahoo][], Sunnyvale CA

#### Manager, Release Management - September 2011 to present

I manage a team of three people who are responsible for software
releases across all of Yahoo Communications (including Mail and
Messenger). My team sets standards for software releases, plans the
releases, and pushes the software to production servers. We regularly
push changes to 10,000 servers a week. I cover everything from planning
our strategic projects to writing perl scripts to analyze install logs.
I also coordinate the activities of our Sunnyvale and Bangalore Release
Management teams.

*Highlight*: Wrote a series of perl scripts to analyze mail farm
software release quality. Trained Release and QA teams to use these
scripts to automate release testing, resulting in a 75% reduction in QA
support requests to my group.

#### Tech Lead, Release Management - July 2008 to September 2011

Responsible for assembling, verifying, and scheduling software releases
for approximately 10,000 servers. Develop release and monitoring scripts
in Bash and Perl. Perform all types of Linux and FreeBSD system
administration from remote installs to performance tuning. Act as
liaison between Mail operations and development. Debug and fix
large-scale user mail problems.

*Highlight*: Technical lead on year-long project to convert all 7000
mail front end systems
[to a new rules-based configuration management system][]. This
involved  extensive scripting, tracking down dependencies, and
validating system installs of several thousand software packages.

workstations. Install, configure, and administer several cluster systems
running ROCKS, PBS Pro, and SGE. Install and administer United Devices
GridMP grid computing system.

*Highlight*: Planned and implemented office and network move between
floors of midtown Manhattan office tower. This included designing and

Administered mixed Linux and Windows environment of 7 users. Planned and
installed disaster recovery site. Managed Linux software packaging and
migration from Solaris to Linux for servers and workstations.

*Highlight*: Specified and built Linux WAN routers to connect main
office to disaster recovery site. These routers connect 4 T1 and 1 T3
line between sites using commodity hardware. Created custom Linux
install based on Fedora Core 1 to run on 256MB flash hard drives. I
